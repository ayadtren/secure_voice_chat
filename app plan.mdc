```javascript
// Example modifications to WebRTCManager
class WebRTCManager {
  constructor(socket, options = {}) {
    // Existing audio configuration
    this.audioConstraints = { /* existing audio constraints */ };
    
    // New video configuration
    this.videoConstraints = {
      width: { ideal: 1280, max: 1920 },
      height: { ideal: 720, max: 1080 },
      frameRate: { ideal: 30, max: 60 }
    };
    
    // New state variables
    this.videoEnabled = options.videoEnabled || false;
    this.localVideoStream = null;
    
    // New callbacks
    this.onLocalVideo = options.onLocalVideo || null;
    this.onRemoteVideo = options.onRemoteVideo || null;
    this.onVideoStatusChange = options.onVideoStatusChange || null;
  }
